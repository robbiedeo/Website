# PPP: Personal-Professional Profile

## Express yourself!

For this week-long lab, you will create a "Personal-Professional Profile".
It's your chance to present yourself to future colleagues/employers/reporters/clients.
This lab provides an opportunity to synthesize and reflect on the many topics we've covered in the course.
To begin this project, we don't provide any code (but may provide a  git repository. Check your Canvas course), but of course you can pull from things you've read and or worked on previously.

## Specs
1. Your profile should include multiple pages.
1. Across all the pages, your site should have:
    1. a consistent, non-default style. [The guidelines for the final project would be a good starting place to check for basics](../../projects/1/#professional-practices-and-design-quality).
        * it is permissible to start with third-party CSS such as bootstrap if you wish.
    1. a navigation menu that links to all the pages.
1. at least 3 pages:
    1. index.html - the landing page that briefly introduces you including at least:
        1. your name
        1. a picture of you or a placeholder image
        1. your professional status (e.g. undergraduate student)
    1. resume.html - targeted info for you to easily share with recruiters that has
        1. at least:
            1. a link to download a PDF of your resume
        1. optionally also:
            1. an html version of your resume right in the page
    1. about.html - a more detailed page about you that includes at least:
        1. a longer bio
        1. some sort of "personal"/humanizing info about yourself such as:
            * a list of your hobbies
            * a list of your favorite books, movies, or music
            * a list of your skills
